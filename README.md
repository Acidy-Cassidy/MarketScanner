# MarketScanner


To use:
* Run - Will take a LONG time. It is best to run durning sleep.
  - This takes 45k+ item ids from Jita, pulls the ones that are in the top 1000, highest volume items. 
  - Then it takes this list (which is saved locally next to code) and uses linear regression to show best profit estimates

This is a test build used for dev purposes.
